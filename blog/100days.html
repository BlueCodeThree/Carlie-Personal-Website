<h4>Day 5: 12 April 2019, Friday</h4>
<h5>Worked On</h5>

<h5>Progress</h5>
<p>That cafe script. My problem is trying to access information which is a (and I'll probably use the wrong terminology here) a class object that is a hash of items that I get from my items class. I am trying to turn a string into a variable name. I'm wondering if because I have to do this, I've structured the script in a convoluted way (it sure feels like it). This is why I keep giving up. </p>

<p>I think I may be having trouble changing my mindset from Procedural Programming to OOP. Don't get me wrong, I can understand classes and I have made a version of my cafe app using one class. What I am having trouble with is making everything more object orientated, and my planning the cafe out on paper didn't help when it came to putting it all together. </p>

<p>I did a bit of research on OOP. I think I just need practice, but I am done with the cafe business. It could be fun to try a game instead, to practice using classes and OOP.  </p>

<h3 id ="day_4">4. Classes Conquer Me?</h3>
<h4>Day 4: 11 April 2019</h4>
<h5>Worked On</h5>
<!-- <span class="image right"><a href="../images/random-name.jpg"><img src="../images/random-name.jpg" alt="my random name generator code"></a></span> -->
<ul>
    <li>My cafe challenge using classes</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/10_unique.rb">Challenge 10</a> of my courses daily challenges</li>
</ul>

<h5>Progress</h5>
<p>I tried to make my vision for my Cafe app work, using multiple classes in the one project, but I dunno... I dunno... </p>

<p>My vision was to have two separate classes (items and order), but I was having trouble to make the whole thing work. My trouble was trying to get the items to be added to the order and then the qtys to be updated. I feel like I am making it too complicated and I have the two classes too entwined with each other, but I am having trouble picturing how it is supposed to be structured. I have drawn out diagrams and such. I would have an epiphany, move forward a bit, but then somehow feel like it is still not working how it should be working. </p>

<p>One thing I like about what I was doing, however, was making it so that if you add more items you wouldn't have to update the rest of the code. </p>

<p>I gave up in the afternoon and redid the exercise with one class. It works...</p>

<p>Later in the evening I was talking out what I had done with my partner (rubber ducking I guess), and I kind of motivated myself to keep pushing with the Cafe challenge. Right now it's in a folder called <a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/commit/78cf00fef09383d45b24c7a6a6bedd9f61e850ae#diff-2d5df7945c54c6c51f8078bfdb8ce06f">failed_attempt</a> - let's see if I can turn that around...</p>

<h3 id="day_3">3. Class Confusion in Ruby</h3>
<h4>Day 3: 10 April 2019 - Wednesday</h4>
<h5>Worked On</h5>
<!-- <span class="image right"><a href="../images/random-name.jpg"><img src="../images/random-name.jpg" alt="my random name generator code"></a></span> -->
<ul>
	<li>Learning more about classes - inheritance and modules</li>
	<li>Listening to motivational talk by Josh Wulf</li>
	<li>Trying to apply my "knowledge" on classes in a cafe challenge. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Progress</h5>
<p>In class today I learnt about inheritance and modules with classes. I get understand the concept, but I definitely
	need more practice in applying classes in my projects. </p>

<p>In class we had a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/sitapati">Josh Wulf</a>, who created <a
		href="https://www.magikcraft.io/">magikcraft</a> (ooh, look, that website is using the same template as here!). The
	quote I wrote down was:</p>

<blockquote>"Create cool things and make a difference in the world." - <k>Josh Wulf</k>
</blockquote>

<p>He also spoke about participating in open source projects, participating in conferences, as well as personal and
	professional development within the software engineering space.</p>

<p>I have been trying to apply what I've learnt about classes to a challenge about orders in a cafe, but I am confusing
	myself. Hopefully some sleep will help.</p>

									<h4>Day 2: 9 April 2019 - Tuesday</h4>
									<h5>Worked On</h5>
									<!-- <span class="image right"><a href="../images/random-name.jpg"><img src="../images/random-name.jpg" alt="my random name generator code"></a></span> -->
									<ul>
										<li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/09_vowels.rb">Completed Daily Challenge</a> - counting vowels. But I know there is a better solution.</li>
										<li>Learning about <a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/Ruby-Exercises/commit/c9266c8a71dde4fd2833a445ee6826bf35b1a075#diff-1d1617be208630a2091a5412270471e0">classes in Ruby</a></li>
										<li>Redoing my bank app from scratch - this time using classes.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h5>Progress</h5>
									<p>Classes and OOP is something that I have touched on before, but I definitely need more practice using and applying my knowledge. I'm glad that we are up to this section in my course, and I'm excited to move forward with this. Hope I can get my head around it easily. </p>
									
									<p>Our task in class was to create a class about a cat who went for walks - recording where they went on walks, the distance and such. I am using Vim for VS Code (I really like it, but just need to keep practicing and changing some of the keyboard shortcuts that have overridden some things). I had been in insert mode for a long time, and I dunno what happened but Vim suddenly went into normal mode and deleted all my hard work!! And I freaked out, pressed a bunch of random buttons, and lost the ability to redo my work. Annoying!</p>

									<p>However, I had worked out what I was doing by that point and it was quick to redo everything I had done. Thank goodness. </p>

									<h3 id="day_1">1. Methods/Functions</h3>
									<h4>Day 1: 8 April 2019 - Monday</h4>
									<h5>Worked On</h5>
									<span class="image right"><a href="../images/random-name.jpg"><img src="../images/random-name.jpg" alt="my random name generator code"></a></span>
									<ul>
										<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/CoderAcademy-BRI/gt19/blob/master/random_name.rb"">random name generator</a> for picking volunteers for doing things in my class</li>
										<li>Ping Pong - a skill all coders must master, it seems</li>
										<li>Trying to learn as much as I can about classes and OOP</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h5>Progress</h5>
									<p>Class was not challenging today for me. We went over functions in ruby, which they call methods. I like the word functions better. </p>
									<p> We started to talk about OOP, though, which is good because I don't have much experience with that yet. I think I have the basics down, but I look forward to having a deeper understanding of it and how to use it in my programming. </p>
									<p>I practiced my ping pong today. This is a skill I really need to work on if I'm going to make it in this industry...</p>
									<p>I also quickly whipped up a little random name generator that is aimed at selecting someone to do something in class (such as share their solution to a problem). I would love to turn this into a bot for our slack channel. </p>

										<li>This website</li>
										<li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/08_count_letters.rb">Ruby Daily Challenge
												- Counting Letters</a></li>
										<li>Working on Vim extension in VS Code</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h5>Progress</h5>
									<p>I am all about the memory keeping, and I wanted a fun place to experiment with my web stuff since I have let a lot of
										past domain names expire. So, I've now got this place!</p>
									<p>I am currently about to go into week three at a coding boot camp, and so apart from wanting to have a place to play,
										I also wanted a place to record my progress in coding. Thus, I have decided to participate in the 100 Days of Code,
										and record my coding journey here. </p>
									<p>Today, I'm calling it a pre-launch and I'll officially start tomorrow. Today I am just quickly setting up this
										webpage using a template and getting some content up. I also did one of the coding challenges for my course, and
										through both of these I've been practicing using the Vim extension in VS Code. I think I'm slowly getting the hang
										of it - getting faster at some things, at other times completely slowing down my workflow because I'm not doing what
										I want to do. Still, I am confident I can use Vim tomorrow when I go to school.</p>
