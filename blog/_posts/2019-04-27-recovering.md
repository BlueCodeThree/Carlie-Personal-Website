## Progress

Still so burnt out from the assignment, I feel like I can't do anything exciting, even though I'd really like to work on my music app. Instead, late at night, I managed to do some ruby algorithm challenges.

I signed up to do a talk on Vim and VS Code. Hopefully it'll go well - I'm no where near an expert in this, I've only been doing it for around 5 weeks I think. But I guess I like a challenge.

- [Mode Dependant Line Numbers](https://medium.com/@ersel_aker/mode-dependent-relative-line-numbers-in-vscodevim-eecfa558081) - I can't get it to work, though. Sad face.
- [Map vs Each vs Select in Ruby](http://queirozf.com/entries/ruby-map-each-collect-inject-reject-select-quick-reference) - so `each` returns the original value, `map` returns a new value. More research to be done. 
- [JS for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) - Will explore this at a later date!
