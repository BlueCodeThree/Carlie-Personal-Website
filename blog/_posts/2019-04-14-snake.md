## Progress

The kids are sick. I hope I don't get sick...

Plus I've been feeling a bit burnt out and deflated by my attempt at using classes to create my cafe app. I needed something fun. But what? I was having trouble coming up with something fun.

I have been inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeTravelled">@CodeTravelled</a>'s go at doing first a Tic-Tac-Toe game, and then a Pac-Man game! I wanted to do a game too. Still feeling a bit meh, I had to look up a list of old retro games, and decided on snake. I managed to set up the board, get a head moving around the screen, and then the start of a body to come out of the head. I couldn't get anything more done with the sick kids.
