## Worked On

Worked on this website a little bit, and then did my first speech!

![Vim Wizard](/assets/2019/carliepresentation.jpg)

I did a speech on Vim basics. My proposal was that people should start using vim with the extension in VS Code (or whatever text editor/IDE they use). That way you have a lower barrier to entry, and you get the superior editing power of vim.

People seemed to like it, at least that's what they told me... My teacher said that it was good enough to take to other meet ups, so that is nice to hear!
