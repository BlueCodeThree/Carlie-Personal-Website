## Worked On
<li>Learning more about classes - inheritance and modules</li>
<li>Listening to motivational talk by Josh Wulf</li>
<li>Trying to apply my "knowledge" on classes in a cafe challenge. </li>

## Progress
<p>In class today I learnt about inheritance and modules with classes. I get understand the concept, but I definitely need more practice in applying classes in my projects. </p>

<p>In class we had a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/sitapati">Josh Wulf</a>, who created <a href="https://www.magikcraft.io/">magikcraft</a> (ooh, look, that website is using the same template as here!). The quote I wrote down was:</p>

<blockquote>"Create cool things and make a difference in the world." - <k>Josh Wulf</k>
</blockquote>

<p>He also spoke about participating in open source projects, participating in conferences, as well as personal and professional development within the software engineering space.</p>

<p>I have been trying to apply what I've learnt about classes to a challenge about orders in a cafe, but I am confusing myself. Hopefully some sleep will help.</p>
