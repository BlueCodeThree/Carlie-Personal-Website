## Progress

The days have passed and I have only really missed one day where I have done 0 coding, but I have missed recording here. It's too much trouble to go back, so I'm just going forward and calling today day 10. I do have a lot of links to share that I've been saving for this place, though... 

I can't remember what exactly I've been up to. I did make a super simple Medication Tracker - it was an idea for a CLI app for as assignment (which I have to make tomorrow!!), but we have decided on another idea. I made this up fairly quickly to practice my OOP. I am slowly getting better. 

I have started reading "<a href="https://amzn.to/2IvrYCo">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a>" by Sandi Metz. I haven't gotten far into it, but it has already been interesting and helpful. I'm wondering, though, in her examples of variable names in her classes she is using <code>variable_name</code>, but I have been using <code>@variable_name</code> everywhere. I will have to read about it again, as to the difference.   
I also finished the SoloLearn Ruby course and got my pretty certificate, lol. I don't think SoloLearn is a good place to learn, but it is a nice place to get different examples of the concepts you've learnt elsewhere. 

Tomorrow, back to the grind... My first assignment for my Dip of IT course - will be making a MVP CLI app in ruby with a partner. I think we are going to do TDD and Pair Programming. It's going to be fun!
