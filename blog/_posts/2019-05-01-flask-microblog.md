## Progress

OK, so on Monday and Tuesday I had assessment at school, so technically I was doing some coding stuff. But honestly I'd rather forget all that. So, instead, today is day 15.

We have started html at my Dip of IT, and next week we are doing CSS. I... I like making websites but I am soooooooo unenthused with the thought of doing HTML and CSS as a career. I'm much more excited by either the full stack or the back end. 

So, with that in mind, today I have started the Flask Mega Tutorial. 

It's a great tutorial, so far at least. Really easy to follow, and great to understand what's going on. I look forward to building more. I am hoping to use what I learn with this tutorial to build a blogging platform for myself. That would be really cool. I am actually not too sure if my current hosting will allow me to deploy it. That sucks. But, I will worry about that when I get to it. 

I am also doing a presentation on Friday evening about Vim and VS Code. Hopefully that goes alright. Today while working on the flask tutorial I used vim to create my files etc. It was just so quick to pop in and out of files.
