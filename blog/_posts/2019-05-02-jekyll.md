## Progress

So, I think I'm going to try to turn this blog into a Jekyll blog. See how that goes... 

Oh, I'm writing this entry in vim! Never would have guessed I'd be doing this only a month ago. I may become a full time vim user. Maybe...

I worked a bit with my Flask Microblog, learning a bit about SQLAlchemy and made a login and registration form. It's pretty fun. Typos messing things up. The Flask Mega Tutorial is really well done. Perfect for my skill level.
