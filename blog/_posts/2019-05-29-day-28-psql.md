## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On

- Learning PostgreSQL on the command line

## Progress

Today with school I started learning PostgreSQL. We learnt a bit of PGAdmin 4, but... I don't like it ðŸ˜† It requires you to use the mouse too much, which I find irritating, so I've been spending my evening learning how to do it all on the command line. Now, finally, I feel excited about learning again.

## MVC

Also, we did MVC at school, but I've been sick, so I get it but haven't built it myself yet. When I get the chance I'm going to try to build something simple using the model, view, controller way of building things. I was just thinking a simple banking app.
