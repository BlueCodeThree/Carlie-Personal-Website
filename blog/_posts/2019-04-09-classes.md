## Worked On

<li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/09_vowels.rb">Completed Daily Challenge</a> - counting vowels. But I know there is a better solution.</li>
<li>Learning about <a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/Ruby-Exercises/commit/c9266c8a71dde4fd2833a445ee6826bf35b1a075#diff-1d1617be208630a2091a5412270471e0">classes in Ruby</a></li>
<li>Redoing my bank app from scratch - this time using classes.</li>

## Progress

<p>Classes and OOP is something that I have touched on before, but I definitely need more practice using and applying my knowledge. I'm glad that we are up to this section in my course, and I'm excited to move forward with this. Hope I can get my head around it easily. </p>

<p>Our task in class was to create a class about a cat who went for walks - recording where they went on walks, the distance and such. I am using Vim for VS Code (I really like it, but just need to keep practicing and changing some of the keyboard shortcuts that have overridden some things). I had been in insert mode for a long time, and I dunno what happened but Vim suddenly went into normal mode and deleted all my hard work!! And I freaked out, pressed a bunch of random buttons, and lost the ability to redo my work. Annoying!</p>

<p>However, I had worked out what I was doing by that point and it was quick to redo everything I had done. Thank goodness. </p>
