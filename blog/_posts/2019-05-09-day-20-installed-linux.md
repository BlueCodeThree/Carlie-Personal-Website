## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On

Linux is now installed on my machine. Windows is gone! So far I am enjoying the experience and a fresh start, but it is a bit of a pain in the arse trying to get all the things reinstalled. My biggest annoyance - and there has been a few - is maybe just that I am sure I uploaded my coursework from yesterday to github, but I guess I didn't push.

I have Pop Os as my distro. It's very nice. So far no complaints. I guess it's early days.
