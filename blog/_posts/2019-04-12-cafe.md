## Worked On

- [ Cafe Ordering Script ](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/tree/master/cafe)
- Used a fellow classmate's code to update my name generator, and then did my first pull request!
- Daily Challenge - [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/11_fizzbuzz.rb)

## Progress

That cafe script. My problem is trying to access information which is a (and I'll probably use the wrong terminology here) a class object that is a hash of items that I get from my items class. I am trying to turn a string into a variable name. I'm wondering if because I have to do this, I've structured the script in a convoluted way (it sure feels like it). This is why I keep giving up. 

I think I may be having trouble changing my mindset from Procedural Programming to OOP. Don't get me wrong, I can understand classes and I have made a version of my cafe app using one class. What I am having trouble with is making everything more object orientated, and my planning the cafe out on paper didn't help when it came to putting it all together. 

I did a bit of research on OOP. I think I just need practice, but I am done with the cafe business. It could be fun to try a game instead, to practice using classes and OOP.
