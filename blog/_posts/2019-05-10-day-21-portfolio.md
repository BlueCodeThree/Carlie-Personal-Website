## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On

Started working on my portfolio!

I haven't done much, taking it slow because I haven't learnt sass yet. But, I have started a mood board.

Because I've switched to linux, I've been using gimp and I have no idea what I'm doing. I miss photoshop. But anyway, I want to use navy blue and hot pink as my website colours.

I also have started my website wireframe, but I really am not sure how I am doing this, so I haven't gotten too far. I'm using [mockflow](http://mockflow.com).

I also researched how to use the classic hamburger menu for mobile. I am probably going to do a simple css approach, no js - you can do some really cool animations with just css which I may or may not do.
