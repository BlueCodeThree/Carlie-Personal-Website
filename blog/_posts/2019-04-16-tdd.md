## Worked On

- [Daily Challenge - Hackerman](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/14_hackerman.rb)
- [Redo Challenge - FizzBuzz](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/11_fizzbuzz.rb)

## Progress
Class today (what I heard - I was home with a sick kid) was about Test Driven Development, and it made a lot of sense. I already do this but in a really informal way. And, of course, up until this point my projects have been small in scope, so have been easy to test. It was good to see how TDD comes together with an OOP approach to programming.

I didn't actually do much coding today. I did one of the daily challenges, and I refactored my fizzbuzz after getting some ideas from youtube. I don't feel like I really achieved much coding wise today, but I guess it is good to have a rest day.
