## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On
Learn sass, mixins, variables, etc. Very cool. I like it a lot, as far as liking css goes. I... I know CSS, I can do the CSS, and hell, I enjoy creating my own websites. But I much prefer the challenge of coding. Looking forward to being able to move on to Ruby on Rails soon.
