So, I've now got this place!</p>\n<p>I am currently about to go into week three at a coding boot camp, and so apart from wanting to have a place to play,\nI also wanted a place to record my progress in coding. Thus, I have decided to participate in the 100 Days of Code,\nand record my coding journey here. </p>\n<p>Today, I'm calling it a pre-launch and I'll officially start tomorrow. Today I am just quickly setting up this\nwebpage using a template and getting some content up. I also did one of the coding challenges for my course, and\nthrough both of these I've been practicing using the Vim extension in VS Code. I think I'm slowly getting the hang\nof it - getting faster at some things, at other times completely slowing down my workflow because I'm not doing what\nI want to do. Still, I am confident I can use Vim tomorrow when I go to school.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<li><a href=\"https://james-priest.github.io/100-days-of-code-log/\">James Priest - 100 Day of Code</a> - Shamelessly\ngot a lot of ideas for the layout for this page from James.
