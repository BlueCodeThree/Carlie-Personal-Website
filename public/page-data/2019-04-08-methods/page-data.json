We went over functions in ruby, which they call methods. I like the word functions better. </p>\n<p> We started to talk about OOP, though, which is good because I don't have much experience with that yet. I think I have the basics down, but I look forward to having a deeper understanding of it and how to use it in my programming. </p>\n<p>I practiced my ping pong today. This is a skill I really need to work on if I'm going to make it in this industry...</p>\n<p>I also quickly whipped up a little random name generator that is aimed at selecting someone to do something in class (such as share their solution to a problem). I would love to turn this into a bot for our slack channel. </p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260\">Object Oriented Programming Concepts</a></li>","frontmatter":{"path":"/2019-04-08-methods","title":"Day 1: Methods/Functions","author":"Carlie Hamilton","date":"2019-04-08","categories":"developer","tags":"ruby 100DaysOfCode"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
