## Worked On

<li>My cafe challenge using classes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/10_unique.rb">Challenge 10</a> of my courses daily challenges</li>

## Progress 

<p>I tried to make my vision for my Cafe app work, using multiple classes in the one project, but I dunno... I dunno... </p>

<p>My vision was to have two separate classes (items and order), but I was having trouble to make the whole thing work. My trouble was trying to get the items to be added to the order and then the qtys to be updated. I feel like I am making it too complicated and I have the two classes too entwined with each other, but I am having trouble picturing how it is supposed to be structured. I have drawn out diagrams and such. I would have an epiphany, move forward a bit, but then somehow feel like it is still not working how it should be working. </p>

<p>One thing I like about what I was doing, however, was making it so that if you add more items you wouldn't have to update the rest of the code. </p>

<p>I gave up in the afternoon and redid the exercise with one class. It works...</p>

<p>Later in the evening I was talking out what I had done with my partner (rubber ducking I guess), and I kind of motivated myself to keep pushing with the Cafe challenge. Right now it's in a folder called <a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/commit/78cf00fef09383d45b24c7a6a6bedd9f61e850ae#diff-2d5df7945c54c6c51f8078bfdb8ce06f">failed_attempt</a> - let's see if I can turn that around...</p>
