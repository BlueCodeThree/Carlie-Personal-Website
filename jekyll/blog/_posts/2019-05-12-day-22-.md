## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On

- [Ruby Challenge 21 - Sort Numbers](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/21_sort_numbers.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 22 - Exes and Ohs](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/22_exes_ohs.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 23 - First Non Repeating](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/23_first_non_repeating.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 24 - Isogram](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/24_isogram.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 25 - Remove Adjacent Duplicates](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/25_remove_adjacent_duplicates.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 26 - Max Min](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/26_max_min.rb)
- [Ruby Challenge 27 - In Array Strict](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/27_in_array_strict.rb)

## Progress

Maths. ðŸ˜† The daily ruby challenges are really stretching my maths skills now.

Challenge 21 was about sorting, and then looking at sorting algorithms and implementing them in ruby. Once I read about it I can understand what is happening, but I can't apply what I've read without help (or serious copying, even if it is translating from python). Hopefully this kind of thinking will just become easier the more I'm exposed to it. I plan on looking at a few more sorting algorithms.

Challenge 22 was a bit challenging too, but from then on it was smooth sailing, it was fairly easy to power through the rest. I'm not sure if it was because I was warmed up or what. It felt good to power through them after trying to get my head around 21.
