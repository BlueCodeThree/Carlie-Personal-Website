## Worked On

<li>Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/CoderAcademy-BRI/gt19/blob/master/random_name.rb">random name generator</a> for picking volunteers for doing things in my class</li>
<li>Ping Pong - a skill all coders must master, it seems</li>
<li>Trying to learn as much as I can about classes and OOP</li>

## Progress

<p>Class was not challenging today for me. We went over functions in ruby, which they call methods. I like the word functions better. </p>
<p> We started to talk about OOP, though, which is good because I don't have much experience with that yet. I think I have the basics down, but I look forward to having a deeper understanding of it and how to use it in my programming. </p>
<p>I practiced my ping pong today. This is a skill I really need to work on if I'm going to make it in this industry...</p>
<p>I also quickly whipped up a little random name generator that is aimed at selecting someone to do something in class (such as share their solution to a problem). I would love to turn this into a bot for our slack channel. </p>
