## Progress

Today I made a minimum viable snake game! There are a lot of features to add, but the game works!

The thing I had the most trouble with was just getting the syntax right for the randomly spawning food - I kept on leaving a step out. But, happily, even with that, my idea in my head worked. So it came together really quickly.

Last night I went to bed with a half formed idea of how I was going to make the trailing snake tail follow the head, but as I lay in bed the solution came to me, and luckily I had already been setting it up in the way that my solution could build upon. 

I also got some more practice using classes out of it. I think classes, and how to structure a program and bring it all together -  I may be getting better at this. 

I still have a list of things I could do to improve the program. Such as: Get the snake to move by itself. Allow the user to choose easy/med/hard - this will determine the speed of the game. I still need to make the game to end when you collide with yourself or the wall. I want to save a high score. And, I need to change the walls into emoji. The game must go full emoji.  

It's really fun to make games. I plan to continue to do them for fun. I actually have an idea I want to explore in C# and Unity. When I have time, lol.
