## Worked On

- [Done with my cafe](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/tree/master/cafe)
- [Challenge 12 - Count Words](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/12_count_words.rb)
- [Challenge 9 - Vowels](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/09_vowels.rb)

## Progress

I said I was done with my cafe, but then I made some small changes. First, I just made it so that it doesn't matter how many items you add to the cafe, you don't have to adjust any of the code. That was the main difference, the other thing I did was just expand on some of my comments and cosmetic stuff to make it pretty. 

I really wanted to have it so that it had two classes - in my mind I would have one class for an item, recording it's cost and price. And then another class to capture an order, with an item, and the qty. But, I just can't get it to work atm and I feel like I <em>could</em> get it to work, but I am just not getting it right now. Ugh. But, the cafe is done. I'll stop playing now. 

I also played around with some of the challenges. In particular, when looking to solve no. 12, I wanted to learn how to do things more with one line. So I was looking at that online, as well as adding regex in so that my code would ignore the punctuation. I thought, since I was looking up regex, I would also change no. 9 - this one counts vowels. I did it before with a huge `if letter == "a" && letter == "e"` etc. I knew it could be done with regex, but at the time I wanted to try without it. This time, I looked up the regex and did it again (also trying to do the loop on one line). I feel like I need more practice still writing loops on one line by myself, and I definitely don't remember how to regex, but I understand what is happening and applying the knowledge myself will come soon enough, with some more practice.
