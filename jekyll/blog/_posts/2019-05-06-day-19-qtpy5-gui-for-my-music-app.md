## Worked On

- My Music App - creating a GUI with QtPy5

## Progress

Before I started the 100 Days of Code - and before I started the course I am doing - I was learning/practicing using APIs and Python with some scripts that did various things with spotify. My idea was to just get the hang of using APIs. 

Next in my plan was to create a pretty (or, it doesn't have to be pretty... Just functional) GUI to bring the scripts together. 

I started by trying Tkinter. I decided on that because it seemed simple, but I think it was perhaps too simple and I didn't have enough control over what I wanted to do.

So today I finally got around to my second choice - QtPy5.

I started with adding things to the screen:

- Buttons
- Status Bars
- Menus, sub menus, keyboard shortcuts
- Toolbars
- Text Areas

Next I am looking at how to do things with events.

Hopefully soon I'll have a sweet little working app, because I want to put it on my portfolio!
