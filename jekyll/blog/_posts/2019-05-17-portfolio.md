## 100 Days of Code

### Worked On

- My portfolio!

## Progress

I've been coding my portfolio. Oh, my portfolio. I am frustrated because my expectations are at 100 - I really want to have something professional out there with my name on it - but I don't know if I have the skills to live up to my expectations.

I have decided to go for a one page design. I am learning a few cool little tricks of things that have changed since I last looked at web design, things like smooth scrolling and sticky positioning. I admit it is coming along OK - I feel like I still have a lot of tweaking that I want to do, and I am no where near finished everything. I am kind of dreading the task of making my spaghetti css DRYer. But also as that will be one of the last tasks I do, that will be a good feeling.

Already, my plans have deviated quite a lot from the wire frames. I feel like I just don't have enough experience to know how things would translate from the wire frames in to reality, so I have changed a few things to make it look more modern.

My next challenge is to get my projects section of the website looking good. It's going to be a bit of a challenge because my images aren't a consistent size.

I also need some time to do it, I'm not getting much opportunity.

Here is a gif of what I've done so far in mobile mode (mobile first!):

I think it is a warning for when you have your grids defined in a media query.
