## Worked On

- This blog! I uploaded the Jekyll version
- Got not one but two solutions to [daily challenge 19!](https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/19_balanced_number.rb)

## Progress

Today I finished converting all my previous blog posts to Jekyll, and uploaded it live live live! It is not my final solution for a blog. I either want to reinvent the wheel and make my own blogging script (well, I will probably do this anyway because I'd like to? But as to if I actually use it...) or maybe I'll choose another blogging platform that has already been built.

With the daily challenge, I've been "stuck" on it all week. Mainly because I kept attempting it in the morning which is not my time for critical thinking. Tonight I went on it and got two solutions. I usually do something a bit longer and then I like to see if I can make it "better".
