I am finally getting my blog up and running again. Today I did the [GatsbyJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YhqQ2ZW1sc) by Traversy Media to get the blog section up and running.

Also, I am using Typescript, so I had to convert a bit from his tutorial to typescript, mainly just creating some interfaces.

This is my first experience with graphql as well, and as it's just a light introduction it seems really cool and fun. Can I now put graphql on my resume? ðŸ˜†
