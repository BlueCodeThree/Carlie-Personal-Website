## Worked On

<li>This website</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BlueCodeThree/ruby-challenges/blob/master/08_count_letters.rb">Ruby Daily Challenge - Counting Letters</a></li>
<li>Working on Vim extension in VS Code</li>

## Progress

<p>I am all about the memory keeping, and I wanted a fun place to experiment with my web stuff since I have let a lot of
past domain names expire. So, I've now got this place!</p>
<p>I am currently about to go into week three at a coding boot camp, and so apart from wanting to have a place to play,
I also wanted a place to record my progress in coding. Thus, I have decided to participate in the 100 Days of Code,
and record my coding journey here. </p>
<p>Today, I'm calling it a pre-launch and I'll officially start tomorrow. Today I am just quickly setting up this
webpage using a template and getting some content up. I also did one of the coding challenges for my course, and
through both of these I've been practicing using the Vim extension in VS Code. I think I'm slowly getting the hang
of it - getting faster at some things, at other times completely slowing down my workflow because I'm not doing what
I want to do. Still, I am confident I can use Vim tomorrow when I go to school.</p>
